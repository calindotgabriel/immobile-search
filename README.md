## üéØ What I Built

Property search platform with microservices architecture designed for Austria's real estate market. Built a hybrid AWS infrastructure combining serverless and traditional server components to handle thousands of daily searches efficiently.

**Key Features:**
- Distributed search service with geolocation filtering
- Multi-tenant authentication across microservices
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates
- Auto-scaling search and user management services
- Cross-service communication with API Gateway

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

**Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Query

**Microservices:** Node.js, Express, distributed across AWS Lambda and EC2

**Data Layer:** PostgreSQL (RDS), Redis (ElastiCache), S3 for assets

**Infrastructure:** AWS API Gateway, Lambda, EC2, Application Load Balancer

## üîß Microservices Design

### Service Architecture
Built as independent microservices communicating through API Gateway and internal service mesh:

- **Search Service:** Handles property queries and filtering logic
- **User Service:** Authentication, authorization, and user management  
- **Property Service:** CRUD operations and property data management
- **Notification Service:** Real-time updates and email notifications
- **Analytics Service:** Search tracking and performance metrics

### Serverless + Server Hybrid
**Lambda Functions:** Lightweight operations like image processing, notifications, and analytics
**EC2 Instances:** Heavy computational tasks like search indexing and database operations
**API Gateway:** Central routing and rate limiting across all services

### Inter-Service Communication
Implemented asynchronous messaging with SQS for non-critical operations and direct HTTP calls for real-time data. Each service maintains its own database schema while sharing common authentication tokens.

### Auto-Scaling Strategy
Lambda functions scale automatically based on demand. EC2 instances use Application Load Balancer with auto-scaling groups that respond to CPU and memory metrics.

## üìä Performance Characteristics

- **Service Independence:** Each microservice can be deployed and scaled separately
- **Fault Tolerance:** Service failures don't cascade due to circuit breaker patterns
- **Load Distribution:** Traffic automatically distributed across healthy instances
- **Cost Optimization:** Serverless functions reduce costs during low-traffic periods

## üöÄ Technical Challenges Solved

### Service Discovery
Implemented service registry pattern where each microservice registers its health status and available endpoints with a central discovery service.

### Data Consistency
Used eventual consistency model with event sourcing for non-critical updates, while maintaining strong consistency for user authentication and payment-related operations.

### Cross-Service Authentication
JWT tokens validated at API Gateway level, then passed to individual services with user context and permissions.

### Monitoring & Observability
Distributed tracing across services using CloudWatch and custom metrics. Each service logs performance data that gets aggregated for system-wide monitoring.
